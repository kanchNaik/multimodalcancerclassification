            "  • Combination of bone tissue engineering, gene therapy based on human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and silk fibroin biomaterials to study the impact of viral transfection on MSC osteogenic performance. MSCs were transduced with adenovirus containing a human BMP-2 (Ad-BMP-2) gene at clinically reasonable viral concentrations and cultured for 4 weeks. Controls with non-transfected MSCs, but exposed to exogenous BMP-2 concentrations on an analogous time profile as that secreted by the Ad-BMP-2 group, were compared. Both the Ad-BMP-2 MSC group and the exogenous protein BMP-2 group strongly expressed osteopontin and bone sialoprotein. Cells secreted a matrix that underwent mineralization on the silk fibroin scaffolds, forming clusters of osseous material, as determined by micro-computed tomography. The expression of osteogenic marker proteins and alkaline phosphatase was significantly higher in the Ad-BMP-2 MSC group than in the exogenous protein BMP-2 group, and no significant differences in mineralization were observed in two of the three MSC sources tested.The results demonstrate that transfection resulted in higher levels of expression of osteogenic marker genes, no change in proliferation rate and did not impact the capacity of the cells to calcify tissues on these protein scaffolds.These findings suggest additional options to control differentiation where exogenous additions of growth factors or morphogens can be replaced with transfected MSCs. Light microscopy of construct cross sections after 2 weeks (A–F) or 4 weeks (G–L) of cultivation in osteogenic medium (B, C, E, F, H, I, K, L) or control medium (A, D, G, J). MSC were either transduced with Ad-BMP-2 (center column) or exposed to BMP-2 concentrations as secreted and measured for the Ad-BMP-2 transduced cells (right column) or cultivated in control medium (left column). Sections were stained with H&E (A–C; G–I) or with von Kossa (D–F; J–L). Bar length is 100 μm. Reprinted from [63], with permission from Elsevier.\n",

Precancerous gland shown in (b) exhibits a clear reduction in the amount of integrin α3 expression along the lateral membranes of the epithelia, while basal integrin α6 expression remains strong.

(A) Ferrets (n = 4) were inoculated intranasally with 5.4 × 105 median Tissue Culture Infectious Dose (TCID)50/ml of SARS-CoV-2. At the indicated days post inoculation (DPI) nose and throat swabs were taken for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. In addition, at the days indicated, citrated blood samples were taken for plasma proteomic profiling and detection of virus neutralizing antibodies. At 20 DPI the ferrets were sacrificed and the right lung lobules were processed for histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Ferret image Healthy Pets, Healthy People: Ferrets. [Internet]. (B) Virus genomes in throat swabs (blue circles) was determined by RT-qPCR. When the cycle threshold (Ct) was not surpassed after 40 cycles, the genome load was considered to be zero. Viral genomes detected in nose swabs showed comparable kinetics (not shown). Due to overlap in the datapoint not all are visible, values are below <LOD = limit of detection.

Estimated gestational age shows variegation with accurate areas (region 1) intermixed with areas with inaccurate low (blue, region 2) and high (red, region 3) estimates. Areas with low attention are disregarded (grayscale). The model is not explicitly trained to recognize tissue types and shows erroneous high attention to some areas. For example, one chorionic plate vessel (region 4) is part high- and part low-attention. The attended part of the vessel wall gives an estimate that misses low.
